## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
#file.path <- paste0(getwd(),"./reproducible/")
1. #Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv",colClasses = c("integer","Date","integer"))
2. #Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
daily.total.steps <- aggregate(steps~date,data,sum,na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(daily.total.steps)+
  geom_histogram(aes(steps))+
  labs(title="Histogram of Daily Total Number of Steps")
3. #Mean and median number of steps taken each day
daily.mean.steps <- mean(daily.total.steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
daily.median.steps <- median(daily.total.steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
4. #Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
ggplot(daily.total.steps)+
  geom_line(aes(x=date,y=steps))+
  labs(title="Time Series of Avg. Number of Steps Taken")
5. #The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
interval.mean.steps <- aggregate(steps~interval,data,mean,na.action = na.omit)
ggplot(interval.mean.steps)+
  geom_line(aes(x=interval,y=steps))+
  labs(title="Time Series of Avg. Number of Steps Taken (x=Time Interval)")
6. #Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data |
total.na <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
data.imputed <- data
data.imputed$steps[is.na(data$steps)] <- mean(data$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
  daily.total.steps.imputed <- aggregate(steps~date,data.imputed,sum)
  daily.mean.steps.imputed <- mean(daily.total.steps.imputed$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
  daily.median.steps.imputed <- median(daily.total.steps.imputed$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
7. #Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
ggplot(daily.total.steps.imputed)+
  geom_histogram(aes(steps))+
  labs(title="Histogram of Daily Total Number of Steps (Imputed)")
8. #Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
data$is.weekend <- grepl("S.+",weekdays(data$date))
weekday.steps <- aggregate(steps~interval+is.weekend,data,mean)
to_string <- as_labeller(c("Weekdays","Weekends"))
ggplot(data)+
  geom_line(aes(x=interval,y=steps))+
  facet_grid(is.weekend~.,labeller = labeller(to_string))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
